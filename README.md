#**The _Crystal Collector_ Game!**#

##__The Objectives__
1. This project is a part of my coursework requirements for the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp.
1. It aims to create the Crystal Collector Game using JQuery and Javascript for the functionalities of the game.
1. It also will be an exercise in utilising my understanding of html, CSS and Bootstrap so far.
1. I also want to improve on my pseudo code writing skills.
1. This will also be an initial foray into writing a README file using some basic Markdown on Github

##__User Notes__
1. This will be deployed and hopefully, it will have some entertainment value....  also quite possibly some educational value
    as well by being an addition and memory exercise for kids probably in the 6-9 year old range.

1. Please let me know if you have comments on how to make this game better or if you notice some bugs.
1. I would like to learn how to code better and if there's a better way of doing things, please don't hesitate to show me...  and kindly 
    explain to me as if I was a 12 year old  :)
1. I am not expecting anybody needing help running this eventually but just in case, email monmaramba@yahoo.com.

##__Final Notes__
* I took some items discussed in class into consideration and tried to incorporate those in as I developed this game.
    * Alerts can be annoying as it can break the flow of the use. So instead of an alert when a game is won or loss, I opted to have sound play.
    * Playing sound when certain conditions are met.
    * I need to practice more psuedo coding as I ended up having to keep changing course until things get running proper.
    * Bootstrap was easier this time compared to my previous attempt.
    * Creating functions and calling them.
    * Using javascript and jquery to change or update html elements.
    * I did some experimentation with the overall look via css. I was aiming for a "softer" look with rounded edges and some spacing between the        boxes to give some sense of breathing space.
